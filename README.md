# Enabling Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Training and Intrusion Detection in Networked Systems through Federated Learning

## Abstract

In the evolving landscape of Machine Learning (ML), centralized training poses challenges in data transfer inefficiencies and privacy concerns. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized training approach that not only minimizes data transfer times but also fortifies data privacy and ethical considerations by training ML models on edge devices. This ensures user data remains localized, promoting trustworthiness and transparency.
Our approach to securely collecting data from edge devices emphasizes data integrity, scalability, and decentralized preprocessing. FeMuDeep converts network traffic to graph structures, ensures robustness against potential threats and offers transparency in its decision-making process. Feature selection using the FeMuDeep and federated model training and aggregation are designed with transparency and explainability in mind, ensuring stakeholders can understand and trust the ML processes.
Furthermore, our research underscores predictive maintenance's significance. By leveraging ML, we can predict node or server failures based on historical data and real-time health metrics, ensuring system robustness and minimizing downtime.
In essence, this research highlights the intertwined future of ML and networked systems and emphasizes the importance of trustworthiness, transparency, and ethical considerations in the development and deployment of AI systems. The code is available at https://github.com/don2c/FeMuDeep

## Introduction

The rapid growth of OSN users has made it challenging to detect compromised accounts due to the dynamic behavior of OSN services and the varied user activities. Traditional techniques often overlook these varied patterns, necessitating advanced methods. Our research aims to underscore the symbiotic potential of Machine Learning and networked systems, painting a vision for their collaborative future.
